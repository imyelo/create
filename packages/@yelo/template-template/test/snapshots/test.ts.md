       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION␊
    ␊
       1. Definitions.␊
    ␊
          "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,␊
          and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.␊
    ␊
          "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by␊
          the copyright owner that is granting the License.␊
    ␊
          "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all␊
          other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common␊
          control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,␊
          "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the␊
          direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or␊
          otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the␊
          outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.␊
    ␊
          "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity␊
          exercising permissions granted by this License.␊
    ␊
          "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,␊
          including but not limited to software source code, documentation␊
          source, and configuration files.␊
    ␊
          "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical␊
          transformation or translation of a Source form, including but␊
          not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,␊
          and conversions to other media types.␊
    ␊
          "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or␊
          Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a␊
          copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work␊
          (an example is provided in the Appendix below).␊
    ␊
          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object␊
          form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the␊
          editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications␊
          represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes␊
          of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain␊
          separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,␊
          the Work and Derivative Works thereof.␊
    ␊
          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including␊
          the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions␊
          to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally␊
          submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner␊
          or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of␊
          the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"␊
          means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent␊
          to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to␊
          communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,␊
          and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the␊
          Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but␊
          excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise␊
          designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."␊
    ␊
          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity␊
          on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and␊
          subsequently incorporated within the Work.␊
    ␊
       2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of␊
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,␊
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable␊
          copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,␊
          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the␊
          Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.␊
    ␊
       3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of␊
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,␊
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable␊
          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,␊
          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,␊
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable␊
          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their␊
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)␊
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You␊
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a␊
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work␊
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct␊
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses␊
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate␊
          as of the date such litigation is filed.␊
    ␊
       4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the␊
          Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without␊
          modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You␊
          meet the following conditions:␊
    ␊
          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or␊
              Derivative Works a copy of this License; and␊
    ␊
          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices␊
              stating that You changed the files; and␊
    ␊
          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works␊
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and␊
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,␊
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of␊
              the Derivative Works; and␊
    ␊
          (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its␊
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must␊
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained␊
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not␊
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one␊
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed␊
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or␊
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,␊
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and␊
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents␊
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and␊
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution␊
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside␊
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided␊
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed␊
              as modifying the License.␊
    ␊
          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and␊
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions␊
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or␊
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,␊
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with␊
          the conditions stated in this License.␊
    ␊
       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,␊
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work␊
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of␊
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.␊
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify␊
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed␊
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.␊
    ␊
       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade␊
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,␊
          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the␊
          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.␊
    ␊
       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or␊
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each␊
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,␊
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or␊
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions␊
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A␊
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the␊
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any␊
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.␊
    ␊
       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,␊
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,␊
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly␊
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be␊
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,␊
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a␊
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the␊
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,␊
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all␊
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor␊
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.␊
    ␊
       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing␊
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,␊
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,␊
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this␊
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only␊
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf␊
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,␊
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability␊
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason␊
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.␊
    ␊
       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS␊
    ␊
       APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.␊

          comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a␊
          file or class name and description of purpose be included on the␊
          same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier␊
